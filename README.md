# fullstack
Fullstack repository, using JavaScript (React) for the front-end and Python (Flask) for the backend. The client application is deployed with firebase hosting and is served by the flask microservice which is deployed to cloud run. 

This is a skeleton of a full-stack application that can be used to develop any web-app that requires a more complicated backend than what is available in JavaScript (Node, Express, etc).
